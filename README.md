Statistical Study and Data Analysis on Classification of Different Types of AnemiaStatistical Study and Data Analysis on Classification of Different Types of Anemia

The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust machine learning model to classify different types of anemia based on Complete Blood Count (CBC) report samples. Additionally, the project aims to identify key hematological factors that are indicative of various anemia types. This will be achieved through comprehensive data analysis, model development, and interpretation of feature importance, ultimately providing insights that can aid in the accurate diagnosis and understanding of anemia

Specific Goals:

1. Data Exploration and Understanding:
 - Conduct an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution and characteristics of CBC report samples using QQ and density plots.
 - Visualize the data to identify patterns and correlations between different blood parameters and anemia types using correlation matrix.
2. Data Preprocessing
 - Handle outliers, and noise in the dataset by doing variable selection through AIC.
 - Normalize and standardize numerical features to ensure consistency and improve model performance.
 - Encode categorical variables appropriately for inclusion in machine learning models.
3. Model Development:
 - Train multiple classification models (e.g., Multinomial Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests) to classify different types of anemia.
 - Evaluate the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, LRT, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. 
4. Model Interpretation and Feature Importance:
 - Interpret the results of the best-performing model to understand which CBC parameters are most indicative of different types of anemia.
By achieving these goals, the project has provided valuable tools and insights for the classification and understanding of anemia types based on CBC report samples, contributing to better diagnostic practices and patient outcomes.
This project was done using R and MS Word.
